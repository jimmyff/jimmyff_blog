      <description>Had a great day raku firing! A friend and local potter runs these every year from her garden. Here are my pots:
This was naked raku, I used blue slip on the inside. I brushed a feather over it to make the dark marks.
I used horse hair on the side to make thee marks.
I used sunspot glaze on striped areas here and it came out with a wonderful coppery finish.</description>

      <description>This took me a few sessions to finish but I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably the most refined thing I&amp;rsquo;ve made. I threw the two pieces and then hand finished them. The paint wells have a transparent glaze on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hand finishing my thrown pots by applying texture. It&amp;rsquo;s gives them a really lovely tactile finish.
I used a bright yellow texture on the inside.
I made this one for my brother and his family as they bought a new house. I etched their initials in to the base then added a black underglaze to make the letters pop.</description>
