      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been Nintendo fan since I was 8 years old and my brother got a Super Nintendo, I was hooked for life. A couple of years ago I realised that I&amp;rsquo;d amassed quite the collection. I&amp;rsquo;ve now finally got around to putting some shelving up in my office to home display it. I&amp;rsquo;ve sadly had to leave some games in storage due to space so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to expand the shelving at some point!</description>
