      <description>During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads!</description>
