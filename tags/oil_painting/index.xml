      <description>Tonight was the last class of my oil painting course. I attempted a self portrait using a mirror. I had a lot of fun with it but I could have done with a bit more time! üë®‚Äçüé®

      <description>Another painting of Elphie tonight. I ran out of time a little on this one! Could have done with another 30 minutes as I think I lost her likeness toward the end of the session.</description>

      <description>Still life week at oil painting class tonight. Had a fun time.

I have actually painted this whisky bottle before digitally. I was keen to see how the painting would differ. I think I muddied my colours a little too much by changing colour too frequently and not really washing my brush so next week I will start using two bruses, one for light colours and one of dark colours.</description>
