I was pretty surprised at how much people were charging for them; £3.50 for a single badge. So classic me, I bought a badge making press!
I&amp;rsquo;ve had an awsome time desining and making loads of different badges! I was concious of not wanting to generate landfill so sourced eco-friendly components. Unlike most other badges, these use 100% degradable clear PLA disks over the artwork rather than conventional (cheaper) mylar plastic discs -which never degrade!</description></item></channel></rss>
