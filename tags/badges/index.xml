I was pretty surprised at how much people were charging for them; £3.50 for a single badge. So classic me, I bought a badge making press!
I&amp;rsquo;ve had an awsome time desining and making loads of different badges! I was concious of not wanting to generate landfill so sourced eco-friendly components. Unlike most other badges, these use 100% degradable clear PLA disks over the artwork rather than conventional (cheaper) mylar plastic discs -which never degrade!</description></item><item><title>Building a sticker app in 5 days</title><link>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2022-07-08-building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2022-07-08-building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days/</guid><description>During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads!</description></item></channel></rss>
