I had a special birthday coming up and I wanted to make a cool gift to mark the occasion. As the recipient is interested in crypto currencies &amp;amp; blockchain tech, I thought a desk/shelf crypto price ticker would be a cool present. I found a couple of products online but they were either not very good or prohibitively expensive so I decided to have a go at building one myself.</description></item><item><title>The many beautiful worlds of Cellular Automata</title><link>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2017-07-17-the-many-beautiful-worlds-of-cellular-automata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2017-07-17-the-many-beautiful-worlds-of-cellular-automata/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in Cellular Automata (such as &amp;lsquo;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&amp;rsquo;) for years. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented them countless times in various programming languages. A couple of weeks back I created a Dart library for exploring playing with Cellular Automata, it&amp;rsquo;s open source and available on Github. You can browse the demos on github or see the library running on my personal website -the gifs on this article were also generated using the library.</description></item></channel></rss>
