I thought I\u0026rsquo;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a £38.99 p/year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!\nThe following day, on the very long \u0026amp; hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.\nI worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of £2.99, pay once \u0026amp; own forever. I\u0026rsquo;m sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I\u0026rsquo;ll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!\nYou can download Sticker Party on Google Play and on the Apple App Store. Please help get the ball rolling and give it a good rating! 😉\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2022-07-08-building-a-sticker-app-in-5-days/","summary":"During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground.

They didn\u0026rsquo;t give me a real explanation or even a chance to appeal their decision. I share my story in the hope that it reaches Google Play and they reevaluate and improve the way they handle cases like mine.\nFor the last few years I\u0026rsquo;ve filled my evenings and weekends building a fan app dedicated to the \u0026lsquo;Eurovision Song Contest\u0026rsquo; (an annual song competition), it\u0026rsquo;s been my little hobby/passion project. I blogged about it when I launched it and that post received comments and applause from senior Google engineers and the official Firebase Twitter account even tweeted about it. The app has come a long way since then and I totally rewrote the front-end to make use of the lovely Flutter framework. I\u0026rsquo;ve translated the app (and even the app store listing) in to every language used throughout Europe (via the paid-for translation service provided by Google Play). The app was probably the most comprehensive app/resource on the song competition with every contest, entry, artist and thousands of photos and videos dating right back to 1956.\nOne day, entirely out of the blue I received a notice from Google Play saying the app was suspended, it was a generic email and the only bespoke part was highlighted in bold: \u0026ldquo;your on-device title does not reflect your app\u0026rsquo;s functionality.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve checked the Google Play policy documents and nowhere does it say your apps functionality needs to be reflected in the device title - (See popular apps: Amazon, Bumble etc …nobody\u0026rsquo;s on device app title reflects the apps functionality, they just use their brand name). My app\u0026rsquo;s on device title was \u0026lsquo;EurovisionGP\u0026rsquo; - GP is a nod to the history of the contest as it was originally called Eurovision Grand Prix. The only reason I can think that Google may have taken issue with my app is due to the inclusion of the word \u0026lsquo;Eurovision\u0026rsquo; (which is part of the trademark Eurovision Song Contest). I\u0026rsquo;m unsure if this is the case as there are so many apps on Google Play that also include the word Eurovision in their title and they haven\u0026rsquo;t been suspended. I would also have expected the suspension email to be very different clearly stating this as the reason if that was the case.\nI sent the Google Play Policy team numerous emails offering to entirely re-brand (and to even change the on device title to reflect my apps functionality!) and I received a single response from \u0026lsquo;Alexis\u0026rsquo; simply stating that my app would not be reinstated. That was the last time I heard from the Google Play Policy team despite me sending them numerous emails offering anything I could think of to resolve this issue. I even reached out to Albert Y. Cheng (Head of Google Play Global Marketing) and Megumi Takada (Google Play Business Development Manager) and pleaded my case, neither responded.\nMy app has been offline for 7 months now and Google Play are unwilling to respond to my messages, where does that leave me? It looks like I\u0026rsquo;ll need to follow the guidelines in the suspension email which states that I\u0026rsquo;ll need to start again with a new app, zero installs \u0026amp; zero reviews, and just hope that Google Play doesn\u0026rsquo;t ban the next app too. Their feedback has been so minimal and it\u0026rsquo;s so ambiguous I don\u0026rsquo;t have any confidence that I know what they took issue with. I used to champion Google Play in the \u0026lsquo;most developer friendly app store\u0026rsquo; debate but this whole debacle has left an absolute bitter taste in my mouth. I\u0026rsquo;ll certainly be sharing this story as far and wide as I can in the hope that Google Play improves the way they handle these situations. Google Play has shown an absolute lack of care towards a developer who has invested time, money and effort, lovingly creating an app for their platform. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not the first person that\u0026rsquo;s had their app banned without real justification and sadly I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be the last\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2021-12-23-google-play-banned-my-highly-rated-app-with-no-real-justification/","summary":"(I also published this article over at Medium)\nGoogle Play\u0026rsquo;s Policy team is judge, jury and executioner.

As the recipient is interested in crypto currencies \u0026amp; blockchain tech, I thought a desk/shelf crypto price ticker would be a cool present. I found a couple of products online but they were either not very good or prohibitively expensive so I decided to have a go at building one myself.\nTLDR: Code available on Github \u0026amp; try it in your browser.\nConcept I thought it would be cool if the device looked like a retro departures board, periodically cycling through various crypto prices. I wanted it to have low power consumption, always showing the latest prices, configurable \u0026amp; attractive.\nHardware At first I looked at split flap displays but it turns out they’re hard to come by \u0026amp; expensive. I decided to go for an eink display which I figured I could make to look like a split flap display. I’d heard about rooting Kindles and using them in DIY projects so I decided to go down that route, I managed to pick up a Kindle Paperwhite 2 on eBay for the bargain price of £18. Rooting the Kindle was easy enough; details on how to do that are out of the scope of this write up but I’m sure you’ll find all the information you need over on the ‘mobile read’ forum. I then got a Linux desktop running on the Kindle, ready to run my app.\nSoftware Using my language of choice (Dart) I decided to make a web app that would run in a kiosk mode browser. I went for the Midori browser as it has way less overhead than Chromium or Firefox. I designed the UI to look like a 7x3 split flap display. I added a simple character by character transition as the display updates which flows across it just like the old departure boards. Also by setting each character black for a second as it transitions does a lovely job of resetting the eink to avoid any ghosting. For the data source I used the Binance API which was super easy to use. As the Kindle had a touch screen I made it so tapping the left or right side of the screen would cycle between the crypto symbol pairs. I also added a configuration screen which you can access by hitting the central column on the display. The configuration screen allows you to choose which symbol pairs to cycle through and the duration to rest on each. With it being an eink display, having a long time between updates results in much less power consumption. I decided on 60 seconds as the default update time.\nThe final addition to the software was adding the clock mode. At the end of each hour it displays the time so you can watch the turning of the hour. One of my favourite features is I added a sun which rises on the left in the morning, and as each hour passes it moves up and over and sets on the right. When the sun sets the moon comes up and in the midst of the night, the stars come out and twinkle. It think it’s a really playful little addition to the crypto ticker and the concept reminds me of those fancy mechanical cuckoo clocks.\nI’ve made the code open source so you can grab it over on Github. If you don’t want the code but you just want to run it, there are two hosted versions: Mobile/desktop version or dedicated device version.\nFinishing touches As this is something designed to be seen often, it needed to look good. I commissioned an oak lacquered frame at my local carpenters. I detached the Kindle’s front panel and sprayed it white to make it look like an artwork’s border/mount. Finally I did some shopping on eBay and I got a metal frame kick stand for the back and found a nice white power cable. A little homemade label with the serial number 001 completes the look.\nPossible upgrades I may at some point port the code to flutter and compile a Linux desktop app and see how that runs on the Kindle. I imagine this would give cleaner letter transitions \u0026amp; run at a higher frame rate. I’ve also been playing around with the Rust language recently, and it would be fun to write a Rust version. It would actually be a really good fit as Rust can run on bare metal embedded systems. It would be cool to buy a dedicated eink display and drive it from a Raspberry Pi (probably a Pi Zero to keep it affordable); You can get single colour eink displays (black, white + red/yellow) for around £50, having colour would open up new possibilities in terms of UI. I also thought about buying some individual 2-3\u0026quot; eink displays (or 7-segment-displays) and using each one of those as a character. This would be quite similar to one of the inspirations of this project (the original block clock). I might order some and have a play around with them for some future project! Final thoughts I’ve had loads of fun making this project and I’m super happy with the way the Crypto Clock turned out! I’m sure it’s going to make an awesome gift.\nIf you decide to make a crypto clock please let me know! I’d love to see photos of your creations! :)\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2021-07-22-crypto-clock/","summary":"(I\u0026rsquo;ve also posted this article over on Medium)\nI had a special birthday coming up and I wanted to make a cool gift to mark the occasion.

It\u0026rsquo;s a tricky problem as I only know terrain lines and nothing else (so I don\u0026rsquo;t know which side is supposed to be solid and which is supposed to be the empty void of space). This shows what I have and what I want to achieve:\nI can trust that the space ship will always be in space (even if it\u0026rsquo;s hit an asteroid, it should never actually be in the asteroid!). Using that piece of truth I\u0026rsquo;ve came up with an idea, if I projected from the ship to the corners and count the terrain line intersections I should be able to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s solid. If the number of intersections is even, I know the corner should be in also in space, if the intersection count was odd, then the corner is in an asteroid.\nOnce I knew if the corners were in an asteroid or not, I should then be able to move along each edge and join up the lines.\nImplementation I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented the intersection counting, if the line is green then there is an even number of intersections which means the corner is in space, if red then there is an odd number of intersections so this is in the asteroid.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve cut the terrain line at the scren edge (and highlighting it with a circle), this is so I can make a nice clean edge on each polygon.\n(Oh you might also notice I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented asteroid rotation too!)\nHere I have implemented the algorithm that combines all the edges in to polygons. At the top there is text that says something like \u0026lsquo;P: 2\u0026rsquo;, this means 2 polygons found.\nAt first I was getting a weird graphical glitch when filling my polygons which I realised was due to the fact my polygons are concave. Filling concave polygons turns out is a technically tricky as the polygon needed triangulating (chopping in to simple triangles). Lucikly Love2d has a triangulate feature that I could use. I coloured the traingles random colours to highlight the trignulation process.\n\u0026hellip;ta-dah! Here is the finished product. I\u0026rsquo;m super happy (\u0026amp; surprised) that my crazy idea worked!\nI now need to reimplement the ship, but I\u0026rsquo;m a little hesitant to continue with Lua due to it being so difficult to debug (and I\u0026rsquo;m really missing static-typing!). I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about switching to C or possibly Rust to continue my playdate journey.\nI apologise for the noisy strangely coloured gif\u0026rsquo;s -I really need to level up by gif skills!\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2021-07-16-painting-asteroids/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been stewing on how I could fill the asteroids to make my space game look better.

About 6 weeks ago I started working on a tottally new reminaged game and today I\u0026rsquo;ve finally finished creating the first proper protoytpe complete with artwork. Read on to here about how it plays!\nGame design Bringing some succesful parts of the previous game forward: There was a lot of really good stuff in the previous game so I brought forward the bits that I were portable and would fit in to this new game. I rescued quite a few bits (including the scoring system), but sadly not all of the good bits were compatible with the new game. Swithing to a card game: The previous game had a lots of classic Eurovision moments in, however they never actually felt like those had consequence in the context of the game. Pyrotechnics, vocalists, it just felt like box-ticking. This version I decided to move the majority of the gameplay \u0026amp; combo-building in to cards. By doing this I could really make each of these classic Eurovision moments feel unique and feel right (For instance Yodelling is a great additional genre, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t work so well on it\u0026rsquo;s own!) and smoke machines combo nicely with ballads. Adding a spacial puzzle: This gameplay mechanism was born out of the theme. As I thought-through the logistics of putting a Eurovision act together I realised that there is a bit of spcial puzzle at play. You lights need to be pointing at your performers and they dont want to be directly over your pyrotechnicals! This would make a full little tetris puzzle as you piece of your act together. Making the prototype I used my dart library deckorator to generate all the cards. That reminds I need to open source that, if anyone wants a copy, nudge me and I\u0026rsquo;ll do it. I cut out my cards with a craft knife which is much better than scissors or an average guillatine. I also purchased a corner cutter which rounds the corners, it makes such a difference and really finishes the cards off nicely. To keep the prototype in good condition I put the cards in mayday premium sleeves So how does it play? I\u0026rsquo;ve made quite a few games now, and encouraged friends, family, my partner and even strangers to play them, and although some of my games have been really enjoayable, most haven\u0026rsquo;t lived up to my expectations. However this game is different, it actually feels really great. It feels like it all just fits together so harmously, the game plays so smoothly and feels really thematic. A friend described it saying it\u0026rsquo;s got just the right balance of simplicity and strategy.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hoping to approach Eurovision with this game, and maybe get permission to Kickstart it or somehow get it published.

Earlier this year I secured some great tickets to the Eurovision Song Contest and in the excitement I decided to build a modern web app to explore and discover the history of the annual show. I set myself some objectives:\nIt should utilise the very latest and greatest web technology. It should contain Eurovision Song Contests historic results and the information should be available in the most used languages in Europe. The data must be easy to maintain (this was the tricky bit!). Tldr: Here’s the app (as of 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve retired this version in favour of my newer flutter app) I built and below are the details of how I put it together \u0026amp; the challenge I encountered, video demo at the bottom.\nA progressive app and a progressive attitude ‘Progressive Web Apps’ (or ‘PWAs’) are essentially shining exemplars of modern web technologies. They feel more like native apps than they do their creaky website ancestors. PWAs have the ability to work offline, be installed on your devices, and even receive push notifications. I’m a huge advocate of PWAs and I’ve done talks on the subject for my local tech community.\nOver the last year a large part of my everyday work has been building a large PWA to replace a complex established website. For my new Eurovision pet-project I wanted something much leaner and simpler. As well as building the app as PWA, I would challenge myself to approach every decision from the UI to the back-end with a modern progressive attitude. A progressive language \u0026amp; framework\nMy language of choice is Dart. It’s strongly typed, fully object orientated and a language that makes me really productive. For web it compiles down to JavaScript. You can even use it to build native mobile apps with Flutter or run Dart on your server or development machine using the Dart VM -it’s the genuine holy grail!\nFor the framework I chose Angular Dart, it’s a great framework that allows you to build robust and sophisticated web apps in a structured and opinionated way. I utilised ‘angular_components’ which are the same battle-hardened material design components that Google use on their own products. I also used the ‘intl’ library which allowed me to extract the text into dictionary files which could then be translated in to various languages.\nBackend as a service In keeping with the progressive philosophy I chose Firebase for the backend. Firebase is a fully managed platform for building applications, these kind of platforms are often referred to as ‘backend as a service’ (‘baas’). With a solution like this, the jobs that traditional servers would do are broken down in to numerous services and you simply pay for what you use. It’s a really hassle-free, modern \u0026amp; progressive approach to application infrastructure and I love it!\nThe challenge of maintaining the data The biggest challenge I faced building this app was how to maintain the data. I really wanted a simple and elegant solution to updating the app but my choice of database-technology made this tricky. As I was using the Firebase backend I choose to use its new fancy Firestore database, however this is a ‘NoSQL’ datastore that doesn’t allow realtime complex querying or aggregating of data across relationships. I would be storing data that has lots of relationships and needed lots of aggregated statistics. Ideally I‘d use a relational database for this kind of dataset but as my objective was to be modern, simple and progressive, I really wanted to avoid the traditional database+server combo.\nUsing Firestore meant I would need to compute all the relationships in my data ahead of time and cache these relationship \u0026amp; aggregated values in my data objects. Doing this also makes updating the data challenging as changing one object would likely have knock on effects to other objects that held a cache of the modified data.\nA frugal solution The solution I came up with to maintain the data was to export it all to a Google Spreadsheet (yes …you read that correctly) and this would become my ‘source of truth’. Using the Spreadsheet I could then rebuild my database whenever required. I essentially use Firestore as a glorified cache. It feels like an unconventional yet rather elegant solution. Here’s is a breakdown of the build process:\nDownload the CSV files from the Google spreadsheet. Using the CSV files rebuild all the objects. From ‘Firebase Cloud Storage’ download the current snapshot of all the objects that are currently stored in the database. Diff the newly built objects with the downloaded database snapshot. Prompt the user with a summary of changes asking them if they wish to apply these changes. Apply the diff to the Firestore database. Upload the newly built objects to ‘Firebase Cloud Storage’ as the latest database snapshot. This will be used next time the build process is run. I love this solution for the following reasons:\nI didn’t have to write loads of data-management code: logic, forms, validation etc. I just setup some validation rules and conditional formatting on the spreadsheet. This left my codebase nice, clean and simple. Rebuilding from scratch every time inadvertently solves one of my main gripes with NoSQL data stores: when you refactor your data structures you can end up with inconsistencies across a collection due to the lack of collection-wide schemas. This mitigates the problem by simply patching any changes you make across the entire dataset. The thing that blows my mind is that this runs in the client browser (as there is no conventional server in this equation). It feels like only a short-while ago that browsers would struggle to do anything complex client-side and now they’re capable compiling thousands of objects from a remote collection of CSVs, diffing, patching then reuploading without even breaking a sweat. The entire process takes seconds to run and it builds and diffs over 3,000 objects. It also feels a really simple, efficient \u0026amp; frugal solution to harness the processing power of the administrators device \u0026amp; browser. The finished app You can try the finished app here (as of 2020 I\u0026rsquo;ve retired this version in favour of my newer flutter app). It’s been so much fun to approach a project with a progressive attitude and a fresh set of eyes. I enjoyed it so much I’ll continue to develop the app (and I have some great ideas for it). I also plan to do more projects like this over the next 12 months so watch this space!\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2018-06-25-building-a-web-app-the-progressive-way/","summary":"And finding an unconventional solution to a challenging objective\n(I\u0026rsquo;ve also posted this article over on Medium.)\nAs a passionate developer I’m aways juggling side projects alongside my pay-the-bills work.

I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented them countless times in various programming languages. A couple of weeks back I created a Dart library for exploring playing with Cellular Automata, it\u0026rsquo;s open source and available on Github. You can browse the demos on github or see the library running on my personal website -the gifs on this article were also generated using the library.\nWhat are Cellular Automata? Cellular Automata were all the rage in Science and Math clubs back in the 70s \u0026amp; 80s however the first papers on the subject actually date way back to the 40s. In those days mathematicians \u0026amp; scientists created the rules using pen and paper rather than a computer (John Conway actually created his \u0026lsquo;Game of Life\u0026rsquo; rules on a Go board!). Stephen Wolfram wrote numerous papers on the subject in the 80s \u0026amp; 90s.\nA Cellular Automaton is a grid of \u0026lsquo;cells\u0026rsquo;, each of which has a single \u0026lsquo;state\u0026rsquo;. For each cycle (known as a new \u0026lsquo;generation\u0026rsquo;) a set of rules are applied to each cell in the grid which could potentially change it\u0026rsquo;s state. The rules usually consider each of the cells \u0026rsquo;neighbourhood\u0026rsquo; (the surrounding cells). Cellular Automata rules are usually incredibly simple. Below are the rules to \u0026lsquo;Conway\u0026rsquo;s Game of Life\u0026rsquo; (here is my library\u0026rsquo;s code implementation):\nAny living cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. Any living cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. Any living cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a living cell, as if by reproduction. \u0026lsquo;Conway\u0026rsquo;s Game of Life\u0026rsquo; (among many other rules) can be described as Turing-complete, meaning they can perform computations (if the necessary cell states are in particular formations — like this). Wire World is another incredibly simple rule that allows the simulation of electronic logic elements —the 80s equivalent of Minecraft\u0026rsquo;s redstone circuits!\nWhat fascinates me is that from such a simple set of rules, complex systems can arise. Often stable groups of cells occur and large complex formations that can even move as a single unit. Reoccurring patterns arise that can span numerous generations (there\u0026rsquo;s a simple 3 generational pattern in the header graphic). I find this aspect of Cellular Automata so exciting -you never know what you are going to see. It\u0026rsquo;s as if we\u0026rsquo;re simulating a very basic universe. What would happen if rather than a very simple 2D grid of cells, we simulated protons, neutrons \u0026amp; electrons? Would we also see complex structures appear; or even simulated life? (aside: Simulation hypothesis)\nThe Dart library The library separates the Cellular Automata rules (the fun bit) from the boilerplate processing \u0026amp; rendering. This makes it quick \u0026amp; easy to add new rules or experiment. I\u0026rsquo;ve added a few rules so far and also added support for \u0026lsquo;MCell\u0026rsquo; rules so it can run any of the hundreds of rules published in the MCell rules Lexicon. I plan to add the ability to have numerous rule sets running in the same scene although this feature will have to wait for a rainy day. The rendering code is also decoupled which means you can easily add/swap renderers as you need, I\u0026rsquo;ve already added a few (WebGL, Canvas, Html) and I plan to add another that can drive an LED Matrix.\nThe dart package \u0026lsquo;cellular_automata\u0026rsquo; is published on pub.dartlang.org. Have fun with it and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to send me a pull request! ;-)\n","permalink":"https://www.jimmyff.co.uk/blog/2017-07-17-the-many-beautiful-worlds-of-cellular-automata/","summary":"(I\u0026rsquo;ve also posted this article over on Medium.)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in Cellular Automata (such as \u0026lsquo;Conway\u0026rsquo;s Game of Life\u0026rsquo;) for years.
