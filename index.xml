      <title>Making Pride badges</title>

      <description>I wanted to buy some progressive pride badges for this years pride so I turned to Etsy. I was pretty surprised at how much people were charging for them; ¬£3.50 for a single badge. So classic me, I bought a badge making press!
I&amp;rsquo;ve had an awsome time desining and making loads of different badges! I was concious of not wanting to generate landfill so sourced eco-friendly components. Unlike most other badges, these use 100% degradable clear PLA disks over the artwork rather than conventional (cheaper) mylar plastic discs -which never degrade!</description>

      <description>During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads!</description>

      <description>Tonight was the last class of my oil painting course. I attempted a self portrait using a mirror. I had a lot of fun with it but I could have done with a bit more time! üë®‚Äçüé®

      <description>Still life week at oil painting class tonight. Had a fun time.
Source: from life.
I have actually painted this whisky bottle before digitally. I was keen to see how the painting would differ. I think I muddied my colours a little too much by changing colour too frequently and not really washing my brush so next week I will start using two bruses, one for light colours and one of dark colours.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been Nintendo fan since I was 8 years old and my brother got a Super Nintendo, I was hooked for life. A couple of years ago I realised that I&amp;rsquo;d amassed quite the collection. I&amp;rsquo;ve now finally got around to putting some shelving up in my office to home display it. I&amp;rsquo;ve sadly had to leave some games in storage due to space so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to expand the shelving at some point!</description>

      <description>(I also published this article over at Medium)
Google Play&amp;rsquo;s Policy team is judge, jury and executioner. They didn&amp;rsquo;t give me a real explanation or even a chance to appeal their decision. I share my story in the hope that it reaches Google Play and they reevaluate and improve the way they handle cases like mine.
For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve filled my evenings and weekends building a fan app dedicated to the &amp;lsquo;Eurovision Song Contest&amp;rsquo; (an annual song competition), it&amp;rsquo;s been my little hobby/passion project.</description>

      <description>Met up with some friends today and spent the afternoon chatting away whilst doing some sketching at the Leeds City Museum. This was a statue of Dorothy Una Ratcliffe (A Yorkshire poet). It was made out of dark stone and I loved the way the light was bouncing off it.
After the first sketch we sketched a plant in the cafe whilst sipping hot choclates.</description>

I also figured it would be a fun project to learn Rust on. So without further adieu, behold&amp;hellip; the first thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made in rust!</description>

I had a special birthday coming up and I wanted to make a cool gift to mark the occasion. As the recipient is interested in crypto currencies &amp;amp; blockchain tech, I thought a desk/shelf crypto price ticker would be a cool present. I found a couple of products online but they were either not very good or prohibitively expensive so I decided to have a go at building one myself.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been stewing on how I could fill the asteroids to make my space game look better. It&amp;rsquo;s a tricky problem as I only know terrain lines and nothing else (so I don&amp;rsquo;t know which side is supposed to be solid and which is supposed to be the empty void of space). This shows what I have and what I want to achieve:
I can trust that the space ship will always be in space (even if it&amp;rsquo;s hit an asteroid, it should never actually be in the asteroid!</description>

      <description>My previous Eurovision game took around two of prototyping countless versions and lots and lots of playtesting but I never felt I was tottally satisfied with it. About 6 weeks ago I started working on a tottally new reminaged game and today I&amp;rsquo;ve finally finished creating the first proper protoytpe complete with artwork. Read on to here about how it plays!
Game design Bringing some succesful parts of the previous game forward: There was a lot of really good stuff in the previous game so I brought forward the bits that I were portable and would fit in to this new game.</description>

      <description>One November Saturday morning I did this Santa drawing with the idea to make our first ever homemade Christmas Cards!
Neil came up with a poem for the inside of the cards.
The hardest bit was I stuck 10 little gem stickers on each of the baubles to give them a bit of sparkle. I ended up sticking over 1000 gems on with tweasers! üòÖ

      <description>Had a great day raku firing! A friend and local potter runs these every year from her garden. Here are my pots:
This was naked raku, I used blue slip on the inside. I brushed a feather over it to make the dark marks.
I used horse hair on the side to make thee marks.
I used sunspot glaze on striped areas here and it came out with a wonderful coppery finish.</description>

      <description>This took me a few sessions to finish but I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably the most refined thing I&amp;rsquo;ve made. I threw the two pieces and then hand finished them. The paint wells have a transparent glaze on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hand finishing my thrown pots by applying texture. It&amp;rsquo;s gives them a really lovely tactile finish.
I used a bright yellow texture on the inside.
I made this one for my brother and his family as they bought a new house. I etched their initials in to the base then added a black underglaze to make the letters pop.</description>

As a passionate developer I‚Äôm aways juggling side projects alongside my pay-the-bills work.

      <description>(I&amp;rsquo;ve also posted this article over on Medium.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in Cellular Automata (such as &amp;lsquo;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&amp;rsquo;) for years. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented them countless times in various programming languages. A couple of weeks back I created a Dart library for exploring playing with Cellular Automata, it&amp;rsquo;s open source and available on Github. You can browse the demos on github or see the library running on my personal website -the gifs on this article were also generated using the library.</description>
