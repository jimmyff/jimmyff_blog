I've been Nintendo fan since I was 8 years old and my brother got a Super Nintendo, I was hooked for life. A couple of years ago I realised that I'd amassed quite the collection. I've now finally got around to putting some shelving up in my office to home display it. I've sadly had to leave some games in storage due to space so I'll probably have to expand the shelving at some point!

I also got a couple of narrower shelves near my desk. I like having Amiibo dotted around. They really do lift my mood!

It's crazy to think I've been playing Nintendo games for over 30 years. I probably like them as much now than I did back when I was a kid!
