During London Pride I had a great selfie with some friends but the photo was spoilt by something in the foreground. I thought I'll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a Â£38.99 p/year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!

The following day, on the very long & hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.

I worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of Â£2.99, pay once & own forever. I'm sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.

I've got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I'll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I'll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!

You can download Sticker Party on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.rocketware.stickerparty) and on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sticker-party/id1634193331). Please help get the ball rolling and give it a good rating! ðŸ˜‰
