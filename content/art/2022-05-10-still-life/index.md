Still life week at oil painting class tonight. Had a fun time.

Source: from life.

I have actually [painted this whisky bottle before digitally](/art/2021-10-06-inktober-spirit/). I was keen to see how the painting would differ. I think I muddied my colours a little too much by changing colour too frequently and not really washing my brush so next week I will start using two bruses, one for light colours and one of dark colours.
