Met up with some friends today and spent the afternoon chatting away whilst doing some sketching at the Leeds City Museum. This was a statue of Dorothy Una Ratcliffe (A Yorkshire poet). It was made out of dark stone and I loved the way the light was bouncing off it.

After the first sketch we sketched a plant in the cafe whilst sipping hot choclates.
