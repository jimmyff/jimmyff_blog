They didn&rsquo;t give me a real explanation or even a chance to appeal their decision. I share my story in the hope that it reaches Google Play and they reevaluate and improve the way they handle cases like mine.</em></p><p><img src=banned.webp alt=WEBP title="Banned by Google Play"></p><p>For the last few years I&rsquo;ve filled my evenings and weekends building a fan app dedicated to the &lsquo;Eurovision Song Contest&rsquo; (an annual song competition), it&rsquo;s been my little hobby/passion project. I blogged about it when I launched it and that post received comments and applause from senior Google engineers and the official Firebase Twitter account even tweeted about it. The app has come a long way since then and I totally rewrote the front-end to make use of the lovely Flutter framework. I&rsquo;ve translated the app (and even the app store listing) in to every language used throughout Europe (via the paid-for translation service provided by Google Play). The app was probably the most comprehensive app/resource on the song competition with every contest, entry, artist and thousands of photos and videos dating right back to 1956.</p><p>One day, entirely out of the blue I received a notice from Google Play saying the app was suspended, it was a generic email and the only bespoke part was highlighted in bold: <strong>&ldquo;your on-device title does not reflect your app&rsquo;s functionality.&rdquo;</strong> I&rsquo;ve checked the Google Play policy documents and nowhere does it say your apps functionality needs to be reflected in the device title - (See popular apps: Amazon, Bumble etc …nobody&rsquo;s on device app title reflects the apps functionality, they just use their brand name). My app&rsquo;s on device title was &lsquo;EurovisionGP&rsquo; - GP is a nod to the history of the contest as it was originally called Eurovision Grand Prix. The only reason I can think that Google may have taken issue with my app is due to the inclusion of the word &lsquo;Eurovision&rsquo; (which is part of the trademark Eurovision Song Contest). I&rsquo;m unsure if this is the case as there are so many apps on Google Play that also include the word Eurovision in their title and they haven&rsquo;t been suspended. I would also have expected the suspension email to be very different clearly stating this as the reason if that was the case.</p><p><img src=eurovisiongp.webp alt=WEBP title="The EurovisionGP app"></p><p>I sent the Google Play Policy team numerous emails offering to entirely re-brand (and to even change the on device title to reflect my apps functionality!) and I received a single response from &lsquo;Alexis&rsquo; simply stating that my app would not be reinstated. That was the last time I heard from the Google Play Policy team despite me sending them numerous emails offering anything I could think of to resolve this issue. I even reached out to Albert Y. Cheng (Head of Google Play Global Marketing) and Megumi Takada (Google Play Business Development Manager) and pleaded my case, neither responded.</p><p>My app has been offline for 7 months now and Google Play are unwilling to respond to my messages, where does that leave me? It looks like I&rsquo;ll need to follow the guidelines in the suspension email which states that I&rsquo;ll need to start again with a new app, zero installs & zero reviews, and just hope that Google Play doesn&rsquo;t ban the next app too. Their feedback has been so minimal and it&rsquo;s so ambiguous I don&rsquo;t have any confidence that I know what they took issue with. I used to champion Google Play in the &lsquo;most developer friendly app store&rsquo; debate but this whole debacle has left an absolute bitter taste in my mouth. I&rsquo;ll certainly be sharing this story as far and wide as I can in the hope that Google Play improves the way they handle these situations. Google Play has shown an absolute lack of care towards a developer who has invested time, money and effort, lovingly creating an app for their platform. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the first person that&rsquo;s had their app banned without real justification and sadly I probably won&rsquo;t be the last&mldr;</p></article><ul class=tags__list><li class=tag__item><a class=tag__link href=https://jimmyff.github.io/tags/app/>app</a></li><li class=tag__item><a class=tag__link href=https://jimmyff.github.io/tags/eurovision/>eurovision</a></li></ul><div class=pagination><a class=pagination__item href=https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2021-08-07-frogger/><span class=pagination__label>Previous Post</span>
