I thought I&rsquo;ll add a stiker over part of the photo so I turned to the Goolge play store to find an app. I quickly found that I was spoilt for choice but they were almost all terrible. Despite their quality the download numbers were mindblowing, some of the apps had tens of millions of downloads! I found one app doing it well but it they were trying to push me in to a Â£38.99 p/year subscription! Who would pay that to stick some stickers on photos!</p><p><img src=photo_that_started_it_all.gif alt=GIF title="The photo that started it all!"></p><p>The following day, on the very long & hungover jouney home, I set myself a challenge to try and build a sticker app by the time I got home. As we pulled in to my home city I had managed to create an app with very basical functionality of being able to drag some stickers around the screen, and I had decided on a name: Sticker Party. Armed with my prototype and inspired by the crazy download numbers I decided to give myself a week to have the app finished and launched.</p><p>I worked like a trooper that week and on the 5th day I had the app submitted to the app store! My USP was I would offer really high quality stickers (hand picked by me and all vectors so super sharp no matter the zoom level). I would also differentiate myself in pricing - I would make all my stickers available for free however in free mode you get a Sticker Party logo at the bottom right. To remove this and unlocked the high quality export mode would be a one-time fee of Â£2.99, pay once & own forever. I&rsquo;m sick of every app under ths sun trying to get me in to monthly subscription. I figured an retro buy to own model would be refeshingly modern, lol.</p><p><img src=sticker_party.webp alt=WEBP title="Sticker Party logo"></p><p>I&rsquo;ve got a load of improvements I want to make, and I need to add tons of stickers. I&rsquo;ll be continuing the app as a litle hobby project on evenings and weekends. My goal is to have a genuine sale by the end of next month. I&rsquo;ll try to remeber to write another post with how that went later!</p><p>You can download Sticker Party on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.rocketware.stickerparty" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play</a> and on the <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sticker-party/id1634193331 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple App Store</a>. Please help get the ball rolling and give it a good rating! ðŸ˜‰</p></article><ul class=tags__list><li class=tag__item><a class=tag__link href=https://jimmyff.github.io/tags/badges/>badges</a></li><li class=tag__item><a class=tag__link href=https://jimmyff.github.io/tags/pride/>pride</a></li></ul><div class=pagination><a class=pagination__item href=https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2021-12-23-google-play-banned-my-highly-rated-app-with-no-real-justification/><span class=pagination__label>Previous Post</span>
