<p>(<em>I&rsquo;ve also posted this article <a href=https://medium.com/@jimmyff/the-many-beautiful-worlds-of-cellular-automata-3e09afa8d48d target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">over on Medium</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in Cellular Automata (such as &lsquo;Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life&rsquo;) for years. I&rsquo;ve implemented them countless times in various programming languages. A couple of weeks back I created a <a href=https://pub.dev/packages/cellular_automata target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Dart library</a> for exploring playing with Cellular Automata, it&rsquo;s open source and <a href=https://github.com/jimmyff/cellular_automata target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Github</a>. You can browse the <a href=https://jimmyff.github.io/cellular_automata/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">demos on github</a> or see the library running on my personal website -the gifs on this article were also generated using the library.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-cellular-automata>What are Cellular Automata?<a class=anchor href=#what-are-cellular-automata>#</a></h2>
<p>Cellular Automata were all the rage in Science and Math clubs back in the 70s & 80s however the first papers on the subject actually date way back to the 40s. In those days mathematicians & scientists created the rules using pen and paper rather than a computer (John Conway actually created his &lsquo;Game of Life&rsquo; rules on a Go board!). Stephen Wolfram wrote numerous papers on the subject in the 80s & 90s.</p>
<p>A Cellular Automaton is a grid of &lsquo;cells&rsquo;, each of which has a single &lsquo;state&rsquo;. For each cycle (known as a new &lsquo;generation&rsquo;) a set of rules are applied to each cell in the grid which could potentially change it&rsquo;s state. The rules usually consider each of the cells &lsquo;neighbourhood&rsquo; (the surrounding cells). Cellular Automata rules are usually incredibly simple. Below are the rules to &lsquo;Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life&rsquo; (<a href=https://github.com/jimmyff/cellular_automata/blob/master/lib/src/rules/game_of_life.dart target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">here is my library&rsquo;s code implementation</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Any living cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any living cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any living cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a living cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=2.gif#pixelate alt=GIF title="'Conway's Game of Life' with a patterned seed"></p>
<p>&lsquo;Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life&rsquo; (among many other rules) can be described as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-complete</a>, meaning they can perform computations (if the necessary cell states are in particular formations — <a href=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">like this</a>). <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Wire World</a> is another incredibly simple rule that allows the simulation of electronic logic elements —the 80s equivalent of Minecraft&rsquo;s redstone circuits!</p>
<p>What fascinates me is that from such a simple set of rules, complex systems can arise. Often stable groups of cells occur and large complex formations that can even move as a single unit. Reoccurring patterns arise that can span numerous generations (there&rsquo;s a simple 3 generational pattern in the header graphic). I find this aspect of Cellular Automata so exciting -you never know what you are going to see. It&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;re simulating a very basic universe. What would happen if rather than a very simple 2D grid of cells, we simulated protons, neutrons & electrons? Would we also see complex structures appear; or even simulated life? (aside: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Simulation hypothesis</a>)</p>
<h2 id=the-dart-library>The Dart library<a class=anchor href=#the-dart-library>#</a></h2>
<p>The library separates the Cellular Automata rules (the fun bit) from the boilerplate processing & rendering. This makes it quick & easy to add new rules or experiment. I&rsquo;ve added a few rules so far and also added support for &lsquo;MCell&rsquo; rules so it can run any of the hundreds of rules published in the <a href=http://www.mirekw.com/ca/rullex_rtab.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">MCell rules Lexicon</a>. I plan to add the ability to have numerous rule sets running in the same scene although this feature will have to wait for a rainy day. The rendering code is also decoupled which means you can easily add/swap renderers as you need, I&rsquo;ve already added a few (WebGL, Canvas, Html) and I plan to add another that can drive an LED Matrix.</p>

<p>The dart package &lsquo;cellular_automata&rsquo; is published on <a href=https://pub.dev/packages/cellular_automata target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">pub.dartlang.org</a>. Have fun with it and don&rsquo;t forget to send me a pull request! ;-)</p>
