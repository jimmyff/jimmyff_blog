The crank would be perrrfect! I can imagine the frantic cranking as you try to rush in front of 4 lanes of traffic and a train!
I also figured it would be a fun project to learn Rust on. So without further adieu, behold&amp;hellip; the first thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made in rust!</description></item><item><title>Crypto Clock - the crypto currency ticker that runs on an old Kindle</title><link>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2021-07-22-crypto-clock/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jimmyff.github.io/blog/2021-07-22-crypto-clock/</guid><description>(I&amp;rsquo;ve also posted this article over on Medium)

It&amp;rsquo;s a tricky problem as I only know terrain lines and nothing else (so I don&amp;rsquo;t know which side is supposed to be solid and which is supposed to be the empty void of space). This shows what I have and what I want to achieve:
I can trust that the space ship will always be in space (even if it&amp;rsquo;s hit an asteroid, it should never actually be in the asteroid!</description></item></channel></rss>
